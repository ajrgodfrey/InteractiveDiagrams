Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "Graphics" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces the  tools needed to make interactive graphics that are explorable and should be of benefit to print-disabled learners.
While blind users will have their own screen readers, other print-disabled people will use the in-built announcements of useful information.


We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful for their work because it provides a transferable tool which can be customised to other situations, including public information provided by info-graphics and graphs used in eductonal settings.
